# tekne

Tekne (formerly [meditations](https://github.com/upvalue/tekne/tree/meditations-stable)) is a
freestyle productivity app in the shape of an outline editor.

It's currently extremely alpha software! I'm using it every day now (as of 8/28/25) but it's missing
lots of features, is sometimes broken in odd ways and does not yet have a stable database or
document schema.
